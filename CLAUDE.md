# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a simple static HTML website for a "KungFu Panda" project. Currently, it consists of a single `index.html` file with basic HTML structure and metadata.

## Architecture

- **`index.html`**: Main entry point - a basic HTML page with meta tags for character encoding, description, author, and title.

## Development

### Building/Running
This is a static HTML project with no build process. To view the website:
- Open `index.html` directly in a web browser, or
- Serve it using a local HTTP server (e.g., `python3 -m http.server 8000`)

### Common Tasks
- **Edit HTML**: Modify `index.html` directly
- **Preview**: Open the file in a browser or use a local development server

## Notes

- The project is not currently a git repository
- No build tools, dependencies, or testing framework are configured
- Consider initializing git and adding a `.gitignore` if version control is needed
